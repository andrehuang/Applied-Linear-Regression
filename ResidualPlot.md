# Residual Plot
When points of high leverage exist, instead of looking at residual plots, it is generally more informative to
look at plots of standardized residuals since plots of the residuals will have nonconstant variance even if the
errors have constant variance. (When points of high leverage do not exist, there is generally little difference
in the patterns seen in plots of residuals when compared with those in plots of standardized residuals.) The
other advantage of standardized residuals is that they immediately tell us how many estimated standard
deviations any point is away from the fitted regression model.
